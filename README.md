# Voice Assistant (Stage 1)

This is a beginner-level Python project that demonstrates a basic **voice assistant** using popular Python libraries like `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, and `datetime`. The assistant listens for voice commands, processes them, and responds with speech output.

- Listens to your voice using your microphone
- Converts voice to text
- Responds with speech (text-to-speech)
- Basic greeting functionality
- Can open websites like YouTube and Google in the browser

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3
- [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)
- [pyttsx3](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/)
- [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)
- [webbrowser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html)
  
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note
Some parts of the code may reference specific file paths or directories on the developer‚Äôs system. Make sure to update any such paths according to your own local machine. For example, if the assistant needs to open a specific file or program, you must provide the correct path that exists on your system.
